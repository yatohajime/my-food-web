            <h1><span>Tired of torturous diets?</span></h1>
        <p>
            We've all been there; When your tummy sticks out and you feel like your body has been conserving a bit too much fat in places you really don't want them to. So, you turn towards diets on the internet believing they can reduce your body fat and get you lean. After successfully wasting half your day researching, you finally find a diet that appeals to you. You decide on sticking to it and eat whatever the person behind your screen says. Turns out the food selection was disgusting and nutrition value was a sham. You neither lost weight nor did you become lean. Instead you become  weaker than a sheep and possibly got diagnosed with clinical depression. Just kidding.
