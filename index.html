            <h1><span>Tired of torturous diets?</span></h1>
        <p>
            We've all been there; When your tummy sticks out and you feel like your body has been conserving a bit too much fat in places you really don't want them to. So, you turn towards diets on the internet believing they can reduce your body fat and get you lean. After successfully wasting half your day researching, you finally find a diet that appeals to you. You decide on sticking to it and eat whatever the person behind your screen says. Turns out the food selection was disgusting and nutrition value was a sham. You neither lost weight nor did you become lean. Instead you become  weaker than a sheep and possibly got diagnosed with clinical depression. Just kidding.

       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <small>published on 6 July,2021 by Author: Yato Hajime</small>
       <p>
           I am a nutritionist and a gym instructor who has seen many people struggle with their food habits throughout the years. They work hard in the gym or they try to eat properly for a healthier lifestyle. However, they always fail in at least one regard. Most of the time happened to be malnutrition and poor diet. The person doesn't just get weaker but they get mentally destroyed. As a result they think of healthy eating habits as torture. I was no different than them as i also struggled with all these issues. Thus, i studied i depth about food and how they affect the human body. I tried countless things i learnt on my journey for learning nutrition.

        <p>
            Now with years of experience i made this website in hopes of helping people who are just like me when i started.
